# Changelog

## 0.9.0-alpha.1 - Spatial Continuity

### Added

- Optional Spatial Continuity sibling subsystem with separate locations, spatial relations, routes, evidence, coordinate profile, and base-map reference.
- Canonical schema version 2 with safe schema-1 migration; sidecar, bundle, and rollback-journal envelope formats remain version 1.
- Generic Cartesian 2D base-map adapter plus a Ternia v0.9.10 registry adapter.
- Read-only base geography with per-chat campaign-generated locations and campaign overrides.
- Deterministic coordinate authority, profile-driven True North/cardinal math, cardinal/diagonal derivation, optional bounds/precision handling, and route-vs-straight-distance separation.
- Profile-neutral operation: campaigns without a configured profile retain named/explicit/relative geography without inheriting Ternia's 5 km scale or bounds.
- Shared capture request support for bounded `spatialMutations` without adding a second automatic provider call.
- Deterministic `<writer_state>...</writer_state>` evidence-view sanitation for Reality capture, Spatial capture, and rebuild while preserving raw chat/lineage ownership.
- Ephemeral bounded Spatial relevance indexing and compact private Spatial continuity injection.
- Spatial panel with add/edit authority/lock, relative anchor/direction/distance, route association, override, archive/delete, duplicate merge, and evidence inspection.
- Spatial branch rollback, stale-result rejection, export/import, rebuild, and campaign-isolation coverage.
- Spatial live-acceptance scenarios for real Ternia registry import and Megumin continuity.

### Preserved

- Reality Core retains only `fact` and `development` record kinds.
- Spatial entities never enter Reality Core `records[]`.
- Existing source firewall, branch ownership, rollback, relevance/evolution, provider routing, and Story-Director boundary remain authoritative.
- Megumin Suite/Ukiyo is not modified.
- Base-map source files are never mutated by campaign play.

### Reference acceptance

The Ternia adapter is designed against:

- `Ternia_Map_Registry_v0.9.10_Runtime_Retrieval_Acceptance_Hardening.json`
- `Ternia_Map_Lore_v0.9.10_Runtime_Retrieval_Acceptance_Hardening_ST.json`

The supplied map authority defines Cartesian True North (+Y), East (+X), 5 km per unit, -500..500 bounds, decimal coordinates, and curved route geometry that does not redefine geographic direction.

## 0.8.0-alpha.1 - Release hardening

- Ephemeral Reality relevance indexing and bounded candidate scoring.
- Orphan evidence compaction with rollback preservation.
- Deterministic reproducible extension packaging and release manifests.
- Live acceptance protocol.
- Base-map hydration now preloads attached authority on chat load and fails Spatial capture/injection closed if that source is unavailable.
- Foreign imports retain base-map identity/digest but clear machine-local source paths for safe rebinding.
- Manual location metadata, relations, and route semantics are protected from later automatic rewrites.
- Automatic capture binds same-name visible base locations instead of minting campaign duplicates.
